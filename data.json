The impact on those young people meant that they came into school when they wouldn't have done, they talked to each other in ways they hadn't, they respected each other, they respected learning in a way that some of them had never done before, and they felt proud of themselves. Which was amazing. It was a brilliant thing."

It was so wonderful to see students who have never been interested in the past, singing, beatboxing and clapping! I believe that students will leave today with a different perspective, feeling inspired and with a huge amount of positivity - not just about music, but about life! This has been the most exceptional day. Can you please come back?!.                                                                                                      "
